# Encrypt-Decrypt
This repository contains python algorithms for encryption and decryption.

I would put different encryption/decryption programs in this directory, each with its own specificity. I'm coding this program to train myself so the first programs may not be amazing but I hope to create more and more powerful programs with more features. In the long run my goal is to create a very practical encryption program that can perform many tasks. (I do not endorse any illegal use of these programs).
